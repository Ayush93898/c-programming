ðŸ”¹ What is a Pointer in C?
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
Think of it like this:
    Normal variable â†’ holds a value
    Pointer variable â†’ holds an address

ðŸ§  Why use pointers?
    To access and modify values indirectly
    To pass values by reference (efficient for large data)
    To work with arrays, strings, dynamic memory, and functions

| Concept      | Meaning                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `&`          | Address-of operator â€” gives memory address     |
| `*`          | Dereference operator â€” gets value from address |
| `int *p`     | Declares a pointer to `int`                    |
| `*p = value` | Sets value at the memory address               |
| `p = &var`   | Stores address of var in pointer `p`           |
